### Description

Although we didn't do too great in competitions with this bot due to some poor timing, Stuy Fusion's 2018 robot for the FTC Relic Recovery competition was really fun to work on and had a really cool mechanism that I really loved designing and building: the mecanum wheel glyph lift. By using mecanum wheels with 45 degree rollers, we were able to intake blocks with the same system we lifted them up, saving space and surprising parents and kids at demo
events with a mechanism they hadn't seen before. Here's a demo of our intake from the 2018 FRC NYC Championship, where we worked directly with [NYC FIRST](https://www.nycfirst.org/) to demo our robots and let kids drive them around:

In addition to programming the robot for competitions (including some cool tech like a phone-camera based CV system for detecting the color of one of the scoring elements in the game; and some work with hall effect encoders and gyros put together with a PID loop giving our mecanum drivetrain really smooth turning) and wiring up the electronics I did most of the design work and building on the intake and drivetrain. I created a (much prettier) CAD of the intake that used CNC'd parts, bought the
necessary bearings, belt pulleys, and motors for the intake (in addition to the rest of the robot), and worked with a teammate to cut and drill some janky parts that we couldn't get CNC'd due to to logistic issues. After we put it all together and perfectly adjusted the tension on the arms (the distance between each side of the intake expands when force is applied due to surgical tubing that acts like a spring), we got this impressive result.
