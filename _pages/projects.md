I've decided to include all of my major projects that are at least what I'd consider a minimal viable product, going all the way back to my Sophomore year of high school in 2015 to today, instead of just the projects I would show off to recruiters or friends (labeled \*). It's awesome to see how much better I've gotten with structuring code in readable ways, and being able to work on larger scale projects, but of course I've still got a lot to learn. 

Many of these projects were originally for school and have only been slightly modified from that state, but they're still a decent showing of what I'm about. That being said, I'm especially proud of the projects that were done on their own voalition (labeled \*\*), because they were most true to how I see software--finding a problem, and learning how to use and create the tools best fit to solve them.
