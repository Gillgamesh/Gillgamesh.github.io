### Description

A Go-based 3D graphics/animation renderer with primitive concurrent CPU-based matrix library (it'll max out all your cores, but its still pretty bad compared to using a GPU for 4xN matrix multiplication), support for lighting and shading, and rendering basic Wavefront files through a custom rendering language. Written primarily for a class on Computer Graphics at Stuyvesant. 

Here's some examples of some images that were rendered using this project, they're pretty cool. The first one was inspired by the rings from Halo, which orbit a larger gas giant. The third is just your typical Utah teapot wavefront file and a random pear we found on the Internet. The second is literally just a ball rolling. By editing the `gourd.mdl` file you can make much more amazing demos with multiple light sources, more objects, etc.
