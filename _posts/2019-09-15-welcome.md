After some inspiration from my friend Alex, I decided to quickly put together a website to display all of the projects I've worked on since I started coding properly in the 10th grade, letting me keep track of how far I've come and quickly present information about the things I've worked on that can't exactly be conveyed through a Resume or LinkedIn.
