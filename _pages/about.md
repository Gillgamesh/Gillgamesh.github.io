I'm currently a Computer Science student at Stony Brook University planning to major in C.S. + Mathematics and minor in Poli Sci. I've worked most frequently with Java, Python, JS/Typescript, and Golang, and have experience with C, C++11, Processing (Java-ish) Arduino (C-ish) and Scheme. I also love trying to pick up new languages and paradigms, and am always down to learn about things outside my comfort zone if its the best tool for a certain job. 
Some of my current favorite technologies that I've found myself playing with/learning are GraphQL, Firebase, and PyTorch, and my interests include 3D graphics, data visualization, and data science (check out [Projects](/projects) for examples of my experience in these areas).

My real name is actually Gilvir Gill, as dumb as it sounds, and has a cool history behind it. The phrase "vir" (pronounced "veer") is coloquially translated to "brother" from Punjabi, and tends to be used as a suffix (so my name is kind of Gil Gill in a way), but the phrase "veer"/"veera" originally meant "brave one." My tech interests outside of C.S. include hardware hacks/messing around with arduino and electronics, and fixing things like computer and leaf blowers for my family and neighbors. 
My hobbies outside of tech are reading, balling and struggling to learn the keyboard and ukulele. Some of my favorite recent reads are _The Power Broker_ by Robert Caro, _The Death and Life of Great American Cities_ by Jane Jacobs, _Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State_ by Andrew Gelman, _A History of the World in 10.5 Chapters_ by Julian Barnes, and _My Beloved World_ by Sonia Sotomayor. I also enjoy watching Marvel movies (but I really liked _Rocketman_ and _Toy Story 4_ this year), and you can find my Spotify playlist [here]().

## This Website

This website's styling and template is just slightly modified from Mike JS. Choi's Jekyll theme [Paper](https://github.com/mkchoi212/paper-jekyll-theme), and is hosted on Github Pages (using Jekyll 3, of course). It gives me a nice platform for writing blog posts in a Markdown superset, in addition to keeping my projects updated whenever possible.
